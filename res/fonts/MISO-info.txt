MISO is a free typeface. However, 
there is one important limitation:

MISO MUST ALWAYS REMAIN COMPLETELY FREE

You can use MISO for personal and commercial work.
You can share MISO with your friends
as long as you include this text file.

You must not sell MISO.
You must not charge someone else for using MISO.
You must not bundle MISO with a sold product.

Use it, share it, but keep it free.
